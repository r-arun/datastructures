You can use the sample program eg1.c to see how to use the function
create_binary_tree to create a binary tree.  You must provide a file
name in the format described below. Also, create_random_binary_tree
helps you to create a binary tree with random element values. You can
look at eg2.c, for an example. You can use these files as a starting
point for your solutions (see height.c and count.c).

The focus is on easy testability and representation of the datastructure. 
Pre-order, inorder traversals of the binary tree, with unique elements seemed
to be a suitable representation for interview datastructures.

Input File Format:
The input file must contain only 3 lines.
The first line must contain an integer N, number of nodes in the tree.
The second line must contain the pre-order traversal of nodes.
The third line must contain the in-order traversal of nodes.

Conditions: 
	1. number of nodes in the tree, N > 0.
	2. The elements of a binary tree are all integers.
	3. The elements of binary tree must be distinct.
	2 & 3 are major limitations, but you can construct trees with
	duplicate elements using create_random_binary_tree.

API:
The code for binary tree construction and traversal is present in binary_tree.h.

bin_tree * create_binary_tree(char * fname):
	Takes the name of a file in fname, which contains the input as sta-
	ted in input format section. This returns the root node of binary
	tree that corresponds to traversals in the input file.

bin_tree * create_random_binary_tree(int size):
	Creates a binary tree with random node values, such that the
	size of the tree equals 'size'. It returns the root of the tree
	if size is valid or NULL if the size <= 0.

void preorder(bin_tree * root):
	performs preorder traversal of the binary tree rooted at root.

void inorder(bin_tree * root):
	performs inorder traversal of the binary tree rooted at root.

void postorder(bin_tree * root):
	performs inorder traversal of the binary tree rooted at root.

void pretty_print(bin_tree *root)
	Prints the tree in the usual binary tree format. Works not so badly
	for small trees (size upto 12). Does not work well for large
	unbalanced trees.

Known Issues:
	*create_binary_tree functions return a valid binary_tree 
	only if the traversals in the input file are valid. The order is
	also important, with preorder followed by inorder in the input
	file.

IMPORTANT:
	If the elements of binary tree are unique, the preorder and
	inorder traversal gives raise to a unique binary tree, but it 
	is not the case if there are duplicates. A tree returned by
	create_random_binary_tree can have duplicates, but the algorithm
	used in create_binary_tree fails for duplicates.
