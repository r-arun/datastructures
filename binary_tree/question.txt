1. Given the root node of a binary tree, return the number of elements in the
binary tree. Look at count.c for a sample solution.

2. Given the root node of a binary tree, return the height of the tree binary
tree. Height of an empty tree/subtree is 0 and height of a node with only a
root node is 1. Look at height.c for a sample solution.

3. Given the root node of a binary tree, find if the tree satisfies binary search
tree properties.

4. Given the root node of a binary tree, find the mirror of the binary tree.
In the mirrored tree, all subtrees at their root have left and right subtree
swapped. You must return the root of the mirrored binary tree.
