The linked list implemented in this project is one whose state is represented
by the head of the linked list, which ends with a NULL node. Though it is a
popular variant in programming interviews, there are other representations
that are helpful too.

Here is the API. They do not assume any format of input, but there are helper
methods that help you get the input from command line. It is definitely better
to spend some time to develop the format that suits you.

Any change in the list through an insertion or deletion requires that the new
list be returned by the function. This might be slightly cumbersome. This
piece of code may not be relevant beyond programming interview practice.

API:
void display(linked_list * head)
	Given a head of a linked list, it prints the linked list from head to the
	end of the list

linked_list * construct(int * value, int size)
	Given an integer array (or an equivalent container) and the size of the
	array, it constructs a linked list from the 0th index till size-1 and 
	returns the head of the linked list.

	This is probably the function that you will use often alongise display.

int *cmd_to_int_arr(int argc,char * argv[])
	Given the command line parameters, with input representing a linked list,
	it constructs an integer array, which can be passed through construct to
	build a linked list.

	You typically provide input to a program through the command line and
	usually it is the entire linked list from head to the last element. In this
	case the command line arguments should not include anything else and you
	will pass the parameters as such to this function. It creates an integer
	array and returns it to you.

linked_list * remove_node(linked_list * head, int value)
	Given the head node of a linked list, removes the first element with data
	value - value and returns the head (possibly new head) of the resultant
	linked list.

int find(linked_list * head, int value)
	Returns the 0-indexed position of the first linked list node with data value
	- value.
	Otherwise returns -1.

void insert_after(linked_list * pos, int value)
	Inserts an element into the linked list after the linked list node pointed
	by pos.

linked_list * insert_at_beginning(linked_list * head, value)
	Given the head of a list, inserts an element at the beginning of a 
	(possibly empty list) and returns the new head.

linked_list * append(linked_list * head, value)
	Given the head of a list, it appends an element to the end of the list and
	returns the new head.
