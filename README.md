datastructures
==============

Implementation of datastructures for interviews.

You can use this as a starter kit for coding interview questions in linked
lists and binary search trees.

For linked list, you can pass the linked list as a command line argument.

Take a look at *linked_lists/linked_list.h* for the structure and other
implementation details.

For binary tree, you can specify the size of the tree along with the
preorder and inorder traversals to construct trees with *unique* elements in
a file and construct a tree from that.

You can also create binary trees with random node values, which you can
use to test your binary tree code

Take a look at *binary_tree/binary_tree.h* for the structure and other
implementation details.

You can also create a binary search tree where the left subtree contains values
lesser than than the root node and right subtree contains values greater than the 
root nodes

Take a look at *binary_search_tree/binary_serach_tree.h* for the structure and other
implementation details.

This aims to make construction and testing easier, keeping the representat-
ion simpler, allowing you to focus on coding. Interviewers usually assume
that such a code base is available to you during the coding interviews for
datastructures, so hopefully it is useful that way.
